              This project focuses on the design and development of a Student
              Mental Well-Being Application, with the aim of addressing the
              critical issue of mental well-being among university students.
              Extensive research has shown that mental well-being plays a
              significant role in an individual's emotional, psychological, and
              social state, influencing their thoughts, feelings, and reactions
              to various situations. Given the high prevalence of mental
              well-being disorders among university students, with estimates
              ranging from 12% to 46% affected annually (Harrer et al., 2019),
              this project seeks to understand the specific needs, challenges,
              experiences, and behaviors of these students. 
            </p>

        In order to gain a deeper understanding of the user and inform the development process, a comprehensive approach was undertaken, utilizing an online survey specifically targeted at university students. The research findings were meticulously evaluated and served as a foundation for developing essential artifacts, including the empathy map and storyboard. These artifacts, combined with the insights derived from the research, played a pivotal role in identifying both the functional and non-functional requirements of the Student Mental Well-being Application (SMWA).
         </p>
         <p>The primary aim was to create a high-fidelity prototype of an SMWA that effectively addresses the daily needs and aspirations of its users, empowering them to manage their mental well-being more effectively. The project adopted a professional and systematic approach to contribute to the well-being and success of university students by providing them with a user-centric and purposeful digital solution.</p>

        The UX research survey revealed significant findings regarding the impact on students' mental well-being. International students faced challenges adapting to a new environment, study system, and culture, resulting in negative well-being. Communication difficulties, isolation, and anxiety from coursework and deadlines also contributed to increased stress.
         </p>
         <p>Coping strategies included seeking support from friends and family, engaging in personal activities, and desiring a confidential forum for connecting with others facing similar issues. Respondents emphasized the importance of an application that tracks emotional well-being, offers time management tips, and provides a confidential space.</p> 
        
         <p>Additionally, the survey explored the relationship between colors and emotions. Respondents overwhelmingly identified blue as having the most positive impact, followed by white and green. These findings inform the design of the Student Mental Well-being Application, with blue being the chosen base color to evoke a positive user experience.

          Overall, the research provides valuable insights for developing a user-centric and effective solution to support the emotional well-being of university students.</p>

      <h2>Empathy Map</h2>
      <div class="project-container-new">
      <div class="project-content">
        <img src="images/empathymap.png" alt="Image" class="project-image" />
        <div class="project-text">
          <p>
            The empathy map provides a visual representation of the users'
            perspectives, allowing for a deeper exploration of their goals,
            challenges, and motivations related to mental well-being. By
            synthesizing the survey data, distinct personas were formed to
            represent different user segments. Each persona within the empathy
            map encapsulates specific user characteristics and experiences,
            shedding light on their unique requirements. This helps guide the
            design process and ensures that the SMWA addresses the users'
            specific needs effectively. The empathy map serves as a valuable
            reference throughout the design journey, enabling the team to
            maintain a user-centered approach. It facilitates the identification
            of opportunities to enhance the user experience, tailor features to
            address their needs, and create an application that fosters a
            supportive environment for mental well-being. In summary, the
            empathy map derived from the survey results provides a concise and
            professional tool to understand the users' perspectives, allowing
            for the development of the SMWA in a manner that is aligned with
            their requirements and aspirations.
