              This project focuses on the design and development of a Student
              Mental Well-Being Application, with the aim of addressing the
              critical issue of mental well-being among university students.
              Extensive research has shown that mental well-being plays a
              significant role in an individual's emotional, psychological, and
              social state, influencing their thoughts, feelings, and reactions
              to various situations. Given the high prevalence of mental
              well-being disorders among university students, with estimates
              ranging from 12% to 46% affected annually (Harrer et al., 2019),
              this project seeks to understand the specific needs, challenges,
              experiences, and behaviors of these students. To achieve this, a
              comprehensive user research approach was employed, utilizing an
              online survey targeting university students. The obtained research
              findings were carefully evaluated and utilized in the development
              of key artifacts such as the empathy map and storyboard. These
              artifacts, along with the research insights, were instrumental in
              identifying both the functional and non-functional requirements of
              the SMWA. The ultimate goal was to create a high fidelity
              prototype of an Student Mental Well-being Application that
              addresses the daily needs and aspirations of its users, empowering
              them to effectively manage their mental well-being. Through a
              professional and systematic approach, this project endeavors to
              contribute to the well-being and success of university students by
              providing them with a user-centric and purposeful digital
              solution.

      <h3>Empathy Map</h3>
      <div class="project-container-new">
      <div class="project-content">
        <img src="images/empathymap.png" alt="Image" class="project-image" />
        <div class="project-text">
          <p>
            The empathy map provides a visual representation of the users'
            perspectives, allowing for a deeper exploration of their goals,
            challenges, and motivations related to mental well-being. By
            synthesizing the survey data, distinct personas were formed to
            represent different user segments. Each persona within the empathy
            map encapsulates specific user characteristics and experiences,
            shedding light on their unique requirements. This helps guide the
            design process and ensures that the SMWA addresses the users'
            specific needs effectively. The empathy map serves as a valuable
            reference throughout the design journey, enabling the team to
            maintain a user-centered approach. It facilitates the identification
            of opportunities to enhance the user experience, tailor features to
            address their needs, and create an application that fosters a
            supportive environment for mental well-being. In summary, the
            empathy map derived from the survey results provides a concise and
            professional tool to understand the users' perspectives, allowing
            for the development of the SMWA in a manner that is aligned with
            their requirements and aspirations.

        <h3>Story Board</h3>

            The storyboard created for the SMWA (Student Mental Well-Being Application) portrays the user's narrative when encountering challenges and difficulties during their student life. It visually depicts the journey of a user facing various problems and pains that impact their mental well-being. The storyboard highlights the pivotal moments that prompt the user to seek a solution and download the SMWA for support. By presenting this user story, the storyboard helps to emphasize the relevance and significance of the application in addressing the specific needs and concerns of students.
