    <div class="project-text">
      <p>This ambitious project was developed collaboratively by a team of five skilled individuals. We utilized React Native Expo to create a native cross-platform mobile application, ensuring compatibility across iOS and Android devices. TypeScript was chosen as the programming language, providing the benefits of static typing and enhanced code reliability.</p>
      <p>Throughout the development process, we embraced agile methodologies and employed version control with Git for seamless collaboration. The project's backend was built using PostgreSQL, Node.js, Express, and Google Cloud Storage, while Passport.js enabled secure authentication. For testing purposes, we utilized Jest, a robust JavaScript testing framework.</p>
